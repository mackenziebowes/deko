Readme and Docs for using deko/* repositories

## UI repositories

Currently, there is just one:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mackenziebowes/deko-client-solid.git
```
This comes with some prebuilt CSS and stateful UI components to get some basic stuff done.
Very early alpha, don't try to use it yet, will edit this doc when it's useful.
